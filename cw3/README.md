## Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures - Coursework
# Heuristics for the Travelling Salesperson Problem

*Mark: 85%*

This coursework consisted of 4 parts:
- In **Part A** I implemented basic utilities for representing and loading graphs, as well as evaluating Hamiltonian circuits in weighted graphs.
- **Part B** consisted of implementing the following heuristic algorithms:
  - *Swap*
  - *2-Opt*
  - *Greedy*
- In **Part C** I implemented the *Nearest Insert* algorithm in the program, analysed its running time and explained it in the [report](report.pdf).
- **Part D** was about experimentation. I designed methods for generating random graphs of different parameters and constrainsts (general, metric, Euclidean). This included generating random large graphs, where I hid an optimal path. Then I performed automated testing to evaluate the Nearest Insert algorith, and compare it to the other algorithms (from part **B**).
