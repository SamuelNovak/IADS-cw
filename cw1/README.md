## Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures - Coursework
# A search engine for a large text corpus

*Mark: 100% (formative assessment)*

Quoting from the coursework assignment:

> The three tasks of the practical are:
> - **A:** Compiling an index for a large collection of documents using a file-based version of MergeSort. If you have already worked through the Python lab sheets, this part should be relatively straightforward.
> - **B:** Using such an index to process search queries. For example, it should be possible to search for all places within the text corpus where at least two of the words *friends, romans, countrymen* appear within the space of 5 lines. (We work in lowercase.) For this part, you will not be following a given algorithm in detail, but will need to think for yourself about the approach you are going to adopt.
> - **C:** Reducing the size of the in-memory component of the index as far as possible, using the perfect hashing scheme of Belazzougui, Botelho and Dietzfelbinger (2008) as mentioned in the lectures. This will give you experience of a relatively recent development in the field which is nonetheless fairly simple to implement.
